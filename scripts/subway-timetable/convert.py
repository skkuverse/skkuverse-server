"""Build the subway timetables, one file per part of the `subway-timetables` dataset
(docs/how-to/update-subway-timetables.md; ADR 0013, D3). The server reads the stored
dataset; `npm run data` is its only writer and checks every file with the server's own schema and coverage rule.

When to rerun:

    - Korail publishes a new 1호선 timetable (a 사업계획변경 신고, usually with a new semester or a
      timetable change notice on korail.com). Update KORAIL_WEEKDAY_URL, KORAIL_HOLIDAY_URL and
      KORAIL_REVISION below to the new files, then rerun. The same for a new 수인분당선 file
      (KORAIL_K1_URL, KORAIL_K1_REVISION; Korail publishes two or three a year).
    - Seoul Metro changes the 2/3/4/8호선 timetable (a 열차운행시각 조정 notice). Rerun; the Seoul API
      already serves the new table. `--line 2` (repeatable) rebuilds one line only.
    - 신분당선 posts a new 역별 열차시각표 (all_kor.zip; a reversal of the 2026-10 speed cut would bring one).
      Update SHINBUNDANG_FILES, SHINBUNDANG_PLAN and SHINBUNDANG_REVISION to the new edition, then rerun.
    - A served station or one of its upstream or watched stations changes (the line's entry in LINES:
      its stations and served platforms).

How to rerun (from the repository root; docs/how-to/update-subway-timetables.md):

    npm run data -- pull subway-timetables
    doppler run -p backend -c dev_personal -- python3 -I scripts/subway-timetable/convert.py --out .data/dev/subway-timetables/parts [--line 2]
    npm run data -- push subway-timetables --dry-run
    npm run data -- push subway-timetables --note "Seoul Metro 2026-11 timetable"

then the same against production with --prod, from a production pull. `--out` is required: the converter writes
only into the pulled directory, and a rebuild of one source or line leaves the other files as pulled. The push
reports each table as unchanged, changed, added or removed, and stores only the changed ones.

The Seoul part reads SEOUL_OPENAPI_GENERAL_KEY from the environment, and no other variable; Doppler
backend/dev_personal holds it, a config no service renders. `--only korail` needs no key. `--korail-weekday FILE` and `--korail-holiday FILE` read local
copies of the two 1호선 Korail URLs instead of downloading them, `--korail-k1 FILE` of the 수인분당 one,
`--shinbundang-zip FILE` of all_kor.zip. Only the Seoul part needs the key.

What it writes, one file per operator line and day type, named by its part key (<operator>-<line>-<dayType>):

    KR-1-weekday.json, KR-1-holiday.json                       1호선, Korail xlsx
    KR-K1-weekday.json, KR-K1-holiday.json                     수인분당선, Korail xlsx (one file)
    S1-{2,3,4,8}-{weekday,saturday,holiday}.json               2/3/4/8호선, SearchSTNTimeTableByIDService
    DX-D1-weekday.json, DX-D1-holiday.json                     신분당선, the operator's per-station PDFs

A rebuilt Seoul table whose trains equal the pulled file's keeps the pulled revision (keep_revision), so it pushes
as unchanged.

Each file lists the trains that stop at one of its line's served platforms (LINES) with their stops among
the covered stations, in travel order. A line covers every station between its served platforms and, on each side,
far enough that every train is in view for at least 10 minutes before it reaches a served platform, or from where it
starts (ADR 0017, D6): a gap in the covered stations is a stretch where the tracker
loses a train, and on lines that report no departure it holds the train at the last station it saw, late.
Times are seconds after 00:00 of the service day. A clock time before SERVICE_DAY_START (03:00)
belongs to the previous service day and gets 86400 added, so 00:13:30 is 87210; Seoul already writes
those as 24:13:30. Either way the times must then increase along the train, or the run fails.

Rules taken from the data (checked on the 2026-08-28 Korail files and the 2026-10-16 Seoul tables):

    - Train numbers keep their digits, zero-padded to four: K602 -> 0602, S418 -> 0418,
      K4302 -> 4302, K1902 -> 1902, and the Seoul timetable's Korail-run 3호선 3024K -> 3024.
    - Korail: a station is a stop when its arrival row has a time. The origin has only a departure,
      the terminus only an arrival. A departure-row time without an arrival mid-route is a pass:
      only express trains have one.
    - Korail destinations: the 종착역 row writes the underground platforms of the Seoul Metro section
      short (1지청 for 청량리, 지하서 for 서울); each is written as the train map and the Seoul API
      write it (KORAIL_ABBREVIATIONS), any other name must be in KORAIL_TERMINI, and a name in neither
      fails the run. The tracker reads a train's direction off its destination.
    - Korail express: train numbers 1000-1999 (the K19xx 급행; the 서울급행 sheet holds only those).
      A train with a pass outside that range fails the run.
    - 수인분당선: the sheets 평일상행/평일하행/휴일상행/휴일하행 of one file, Saturday counting as 휴일. The
      xlsx writes 인천 as 신인천 and 수원 as 신수원. Its express is K63xx, and an express that passes a
      covered station from 왕십리 to 죽전 fails the run: on 2026-08-22 every 분당 express stops at each of them
      and passes 보정, 구성 and 신갈.
    - Seoul express: EXPRESS_YN "G" is 일반, "D" is 급행; any other value fails the run. Every
      2026-10-16 row was "G". ARRIVETIME or LEFTTIME "00:00:00" means none (the origin or terminus);
      the one mid-route hole of 2026-10-17 is filled from SEOUL_ARRIVAL_FIXES.
    - Seoul joins one train across the line's station codes by its normalized number, within one
      WEEK_TAG and INOUT_TAG. A number that appears twice at one station is split into runs by time
      continuity: each row joins the run of the same number that left an earlier station at most
      MAX_HOP_SECONDS before it. No number repeated on 2026-10-16.
    - 2호선: INOUT_TAG 1 is 내선순환 (up). The API and the timetable name nearly every circle trip 성수 in
      both directions, so a 성수 destination is written as 내선순환 or 외선순환 by direction, as the train
      map writes it; real termini (신도림, 삼성, ...) stay named. A 성수지선 or 신정지선 number (15xx-17xx,
      55xx-57xx) fails the run: no covered station sees a branch train.
    - No destination names trains of both directions (check_one_direction), except one the line declares
      with its evidence: the tracker reads a train's direction off its destination.
    - 신분당선: the PDFs give each station's minutes per direction and no train numbers. Runs are chained
      station to station with no overtaking (shinbundang_chain), get arrival = departure = the minute, and
      are numbered 1002, 1004, ... up and 1001, 1003, ... down in order of their first time. A minute marked
      (정자) belongs to a run that ends at 정자, whose arrival there is derived from the segment's most
      common run time, because 정자's page leaves it out. The termini's pages list no arrivals, so through
      runs end at 광교중앙 or 논현.

Only the standard library is used (zipfile and xml.etree read the xlsx, zlib and re the PDFs). The API key is never printed:
failures name only the station code, the tags and the HTTP status or API result code.

/**
 * toTopologyIssues, the checks a `subway-topology` push runs against the
 * checked-out code's network: revision 1 against
 * SUBWAY_NETWORK has none. Every issue the committed registry failed the boot
 * on for its directions and neighbors is one issue with its path: a named
 * stop that is neither a served platform nor a neighbor, or is on another
 * line than its platform; a previous or next stop with no name; a neighbor on
 * a line the code does not hold; a train-map name on a line with no train
 * map. A served platform with no entry is unplaced and an entry for a
 * platform the code does not serve is unknown, each named at its path.
 * toMissingPlatformIds and toUnknownPlatformIds list those two, which the
 * read logs. toUnnamedStopIds lists the previous and next stops a registry
 * has no name for, as the arrivals mapper names them: a neighbor's own name,
 * else the station of a platform the code serves. A topology pushed ahead of
 * a deploy can promote a neighbor to a served platform the running code does
 * not know yet, dropping the neighbor entry that named it.
 *
 * toRouteIssues checks a topology against each served platform's timetable
 * routes, as the tracker follows them: a direction's upstream platforms are
 * the three stops before it on the route, nearest first, its next platform
 * the stop after it, and its watched platforms the rest of the route before
 * the upstream ones, nearest first; and every stop on the route before the
 * platform is a served platform or a neighbor, so the pollers can name it.
 * Revision 1 holds against the stored timetables (the fixture) of every day type.

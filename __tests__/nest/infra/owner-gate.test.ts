/**
 * owner-gate.yml judges a pull request to main against .github/owner-gate-paths, and the pull request must not be
 * able to change that judgment:
 *
 *   - it runs on `pull_request_target` alone, to main, on opened, synchronize, reopened, labeled and unlabeled, so the
 *     definition that runs is the one on main;
 *   - it has no checkout step, so no code from the pull request reaches the runner;
 *   - its token has no default, and its one job holds `pull-requests: write` and at most `contents: read`;
 *   - the list names exactly the files the owner reviews.
 *
 * Patterns rather than a YAML parser: the repo has no parser dependency. The rules are tested on the mutants they
 * exist to catch, then on the real file.

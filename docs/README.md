# Docs Index & Conventions

> The index of skkuverse-server's docs and the single source of truth for how to write them. Read it before you write a new doc. Why this structure: [decisions/0001](decisions/0001-adopt-diataxis-docs-structure.md).

## Which source wins (when docs disagree)

This absorbs the rules once scattered through `project-docs.md`. When two docs, or a doc and the code, disagree, trust them in this order:

1. **The code (`src/`)**: the final word on file names, constants and endpoints. A doc points here instead of copying values.
2. **`README.md`**: the current stack, layout and how to run it (it reflects the 2026-05-31 NestJS migration).
3. **`docs/` (as this index lists it)**: the Diátaxis docs. `status: accepted` is authoritative; `draft` is a draft.
4. **`CLAUDE.md`**: the agent guide: commands, the `src/` map and the hard rules, pointing at code and docs instead of copying them. Area-specific agent rules live in `.claude/rules/`.
5. **Legacy flat docs** (`project-docs.md` and others): not yet migrated, with a drift banner. The least trusted.

## Folder structure (Diátaxis)

Docs are split by [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/). **A doc is classified by the reader's need, not by its topic.**

| Folder | Need | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `how-to/` | Get it done (a task) | Runbooks: the steps to reach one goal |
| `reference/` | Look it up (information) | The authoritative facts: API contracts, specs, error codes |
| `explanation/` | Understand it (context) | Why it is the way it is: the design rationale |
| `decisions/` | — | ADR (`NNNN-kebab-title.md`) |
| `plans/` | — | Work queues (`type: plan`); an item is deleted when it lands |
| `archive/` | — | Historical snapshots (superseded) |

**One doc, one need.** When steps and background mix, split the doc and link the parts to each other.

## Docs index

### how-to (runbooks)

| Document | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| [verify-notices-changes.md](how-to/verify-notices-changes.md) | How to verify a `/notices/*` change before merging and deploying it |
| [test-the-app-against-a-local-server.md](how-to/test-the-app-against-a-local-server.md) | Pointing a simulator or phone at `npm run dev` — the `PUSH_DELIVERY`/`CACHE` switches a local run defaults to off, the base URL per device, and what still reaches production |
| [configure-home.md](how-to/configure-home.md) | What `GET /ui/home` serves — the banner carousel (images, rotation, the app default's place, time windows) and the tile grids (mini apps, bundled games and links, mixed); uploading a banner and why released apps still read `hidden` |
| [edit-runtime-data.md](how-to/edit-runtime-data.md) | Editing a dataset in the content database with `npm run data` — pull, edit, push, history, rollback, copying production into `_dev`, the `_dev` default and the production confirmation, and `check --prod` before a schema change or removing a referenced identity |
| [edit-bus-stops.md](how-to/edit-bus-stops.md) | Changing a shuttle stop, its photo, street view or map guide, a sequence's labels, or an HSSC station label with `npm run data -- pull/push bus-stops` and no deploy — what a push checks, what stays in code, `_dev` then production, roll back |
| [update-subway-timetables.md](how-to/update-subway-timetables.md) | Changing the subway timetables with no deploy — pull `subway-timetables`, rerun `convert.py` into the pulled directory, read the push report (tables unchanged, changed with their trains added and removed, added, removed), push to `_dev` then production, roll back |
| [register-a-miniapp.md](how-to/register-a-miniapp.md) | Adding, editing or removing a mini app with `npm run data -- pull/push miniapps` — the index entry and detail, logos, a first-party origin in `origins.ts` before its push, the wait before a layout names it, and the order of a removal |
| [configure-map-overlays.md](how-to/configure-map-overlays.md) | Everything the map can draw and how to add or change one — which tier you edit, whether it needs a deploy, and what to check when a shape does not appear |
| [migrate-app-to-map-overlays.md](how-to/migrate-app-to-map-overlays.md) | The client half of the overlay change, for `skkuverse-app` — what changed on the wire, the ring winding the SDK needs reversed, and the fallback config that still points at a deleted route |
| [resync-the-jongro-registry.md](how-to/resync-the-jongro-registry.md) | When the Jongro station registry holds a TOPIS stop list change, or a route's document is missing — reading the held change from its log, checking it against TOPIS, and applying it with a guarded write on `jongro_routes` |
| [raise-the-minimum-app-version.md](how-to/raise-the-minimum-app-version.md) | Raising `minVersion` or `minOsVersion` on `/app/config` — the store release live for everyone, `npm run app-gate:check`, the GA4 impact query, the `npm run data` push, the two 60-second caches, rollback, and creating the dataset from the live response (never the test fixture) |

Production configuration and data are kept outside this repository.

### reference (contracts and specs)

| Document | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| [notices-api.md](reference/notices-api.md) | The `/notices/*` and `/internal/notices/*` request and response contracts, error codes and file map |
| [event-places.md](reference/event-places.md) | How festival places are stored, written and run: the `places` and `activations` collections, their indexes, the sheet importer, a place's `detail` (the sheet's body) and the R2 photo rules, and the runbook for the window kill switch |
| [map-code-map.md](reference/map-code-map.md) | Where each part of `src/map/` lives, boot-time vs request-time work, which test pins what, and a change map |
| [map-overlays-api.md](reference/map-overlays-api.md) | The one overlay schema every map layer draws — pins, zones and route lines tagged by `kind` — the `defaultVisibleWhen`/`userConfigurable` layer flags, and `GET /map/config` + `/map/overlays/{campus,event}` + `/map/overlays/event/details` |
| [miniapps-api.md](reference/miniapps-api.md) | `GET /miniapps` + `/miniapps/:id` — index and detail fields, the `shell` merge order (default < registry < the mini app's own manifest), first-party manifest fetch rules, push validation, and the broadcast feed endpoints |
| [bus-live-api.md](reference/bus-live-api.md) | `GET /bus/live/:groupId` — a realtime line's vehicles and each station's next arrivals in one shape for Jongno and the HSSC shuttle: arrivals as instants, statuses, stops away, vehicles and positions, stop ids and pole numbers, open-enum fallbacks and the client's clock, minute and marker rules |
| [bus-stops-api.md](reference/bus-stops-api.md) | `GET /bus/stops/:stopId/arrivals` — stop ids (`seoul-<ARS number>` for a Jongno pole, slugs for the shuttle and HSSC stops, aliases), the stop block, the live and timetable entries in configuration order, the next runs as scheduled arrivals, error codes, freshness and cost |
| [subway-api.md](reference/subway-api.md) | `GET /subway/stations/:stationId/arrivals` — the served stations, each field, what `source` means, counting down from `arrivalAt` with the device clock, `stopsAway` and the previous and next stations, the stale fallback and what `SUBWAY=off` stops, error codes and upstream data notes — and `GET /internal/subway/accuracy`, the error report by station, direction, horizon and source |
| [games-api.md](reference/games-api.md) | `GET /games` + `/games/:id` — the registry the app resolves a game id against before it opens a hosted game, what a push of the `games` dataset is checked for, and the first-party game origins |
| [logging.md](reference/logging.md) | What a log line contains (`event`, `reqId` = client id or CF-Ray), how to write one (lint-enforced), which lines become Sentry Issues, and what is never logged |
| [cicd-and-branch-protection.md](cicd-and-branch-protection.md) | This repository's GitHub workflows, what CI checks, where deploys run instead (outside this repository), and the rules that protect `main` |

### explanation (mechanisms and background)

### plans (work queues)

| Document | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| [transit-route-planner.md](plans/transit-route-planner.md) | The route planner between the campuses, built against ADR 0022: the PR sequence from the shared call and the board reshape to the four options each way, the `journey-routes` dataset and its push checks, how each source fills the call, the source doors and the planner, the `journey/` module, the PoC options leg by leg, and the subway stations and probes they need |
| [7800-unified-arrivals.md](plans/7800-unified-arrivals.md) | The 7800 express bus on `/bus/live` and the stop page in the ADR 0019 `arrival` shape, and the timetabled shuttles producing the same shape; PRs 1–7 shipped, PR 8 cancelled, the rest continues in ADR 0022 |

### archive (historical)

| Document | Summary |
| --- | --- |

### Not yet migrated (legacy, with a drift banner, waiting to be split)

These docs are not yet split into Diátaxis. Each carries a drift banner and is exempt from the lint gate (`ignores`). When one is split, remove its banner and its `ignores` entry.

| Document | Status |
| --- | --- |
| [notices-api-architecture.md](notices-api-architecture.md) | superseded: split into the five docs above; only a pointer stub is left |
| [project-docs.md](project-docs.md) | Not yet split: the bus system and the external APIs; hosting is documented outside this repository. Express drift |
| [skku-notice-sources.md](skku-notice-sources.md) | deprecated: only a pointer stub is left. The sources' source of truth is `src/notices/sources.json` and the crawler's `sources.json` and coverage |
| [skku-departments.md](skku-departments.md) | Not yet migrated: an editorial reference to the department home pages |

## Migration backlog

Flagship first: only notices is fully migrated so far. What moves next:

- **Split `project-docs.md` (large):** the bus schedule system into `explanation/bus-schedule-architecture.md`, `reference/bus-api.md` and `how-to/add-bus-route.md`; the external APIs (HSSC, Jongro, Hyehwa, map) into `reference/external-apis.md`; buildings are done: [explanation/building-architecture.md](explanation/building-architecture.md), with the 2026-03 data survey moved to [archive/building-data-2026-03.md](archive/building-data-2026-03.md). Fix the Express-to-NestJS drift throughout.
- **`skku-departments.md`**: move it to `reference/` and bring it up to date. (`skku-notice-sources.md` is already a pointer stub to the crawler's and `src/notices/sources.json`'s source of truth.)
- When you split a doc, remove its line from `ignores` in `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`.

## Writing rules

### 1. Frontmatter (required)

Every doc starts with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: <Title Case title>
type: how-to | reference | explanation | tutorial | adr | plan | postmortem
status: draft | accepted | superseded | deprecated
owner: spencer0124
last-updated: YYYY-MM-DD
audience: internal | public
---
```

- With `status: superseded` or `deprecated`, link the current source of truth at the top of the body.
- Update `last-updated` whenever you change a doc's substance.

### 2. Skeleton

After the frontmatter, always: one `# H1` per doc, then a `> one-line summary`. Then `##` sections, never skipping a level. Start a new doc from a copy of [`_template.md`](_template.md).

### 3. Point at the source, never copy a value

**Never hard-code a file path, a version, a count or a test count in a doc.** A doc that silently starts lying when the code changes was the root cause of this repository's drift (the Express layout frozen into the docs).

- ❌ `the notices logic is in features/notices/notices.routes.js`
- ✅ `the notices routes: src/notices/list/notices-list.controller.ts (source of truth)`
- When you need an example value, say "as of writing" or use a `<placeholder>`.

### 4. File names

- **kebab-case, lowercase, `.md`**
- ADR: `NNNN-kebab-title.md` (a zero-padded sequence number)
- Postmortem: `YYYY-MM-topic.md`
- ALL-CAPS only for GitHub's special files (`README`, `LICENSE`)

### 5. Formatting

- Every code fence **takes a language tag** (`bash`, `ts`, `js`, `json`, `jsonc`, `yaml`, `text`)
- Structured facts (parameters, paths, options) go in a table
- Notes and warnings use GitHub admonitions: `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!WARNING]`
- **Write the body in English.** This is a rule shared across the maintainers' repositories. The one exception is product copy shown to users (`label.ko`, i18n strings), which is data, not documentation; this repository declares those paths in `.conventions.json`.
  - This line once said "write the body in Korean". A Korean doc that remains has not been migrated yet: translate the part you touch.
- Lint: `npm run lint:md` (markdownlint-cli2). **The rules are `.markdownlint.jsonc`**, vendored from the maintainers' umbrella repository as the `conventions.markdownlint` contract and hash-locked. Do not edit it here: the maintainers change it at its source and run `sync_contracts.py pull`. Only which paths are checked (globs and ignores) stays local, in the root `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`. Module docs (`explanation/<module>-architecture.md`) follow [`_module-template.md`](_module-template.md) instead of `_template.md`; their fixed sections are checked by the MD043 override in `docs/.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` and by the `module-docs` and `glossary-coverage` tests.

### 6. Lifecycle

- When you split a legacy doc into Diátaxis, move the settled knowledge to `reference/` or `explanation/` and shrink the original to a `status: superseded` stub (a table of pointers). Do not delete it: that keeps its git history and inbound links.
- A structural decision gets one ADR in `decisions/` (Context, Decision, Consequences).
- When you find a doc that disagrees with the code, fix it on the spot, or at least leave a `> [!WARNING]` stale banner.

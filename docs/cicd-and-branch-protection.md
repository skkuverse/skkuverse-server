# CI and Branch Protection

> What this repository's GitHub workflows run, which secrets they hold, and the rules that protect `dev` and `main`. No workflow deploys: production is deployed from `main` outside GitHub Actions.

## Summary

The repository is public. Every change reaches `main` through a pull request: work lands on `dev`, and the only pull request into `main` is `dev` → `main`, except a Dependabot security update for npm (see [Dependabot security updates](#dependabot-security-updates)). CI runs on pull requests to either branch and on pushes to `dev`, with a read-only token and no secret, so a fork's pull request runs the same checks as a maintainer's. Two workflows hold a secret. `contracts-sync.yml` never checks out a pull request. `claude.yml` does. On a pull request, including a fork's, the action checks out the pull request's head. It restores only `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md` and a few other agent configuration files from the base branch. Claude only answers and never pushes: it reads that code with the job's own token, which cannot push, and the workflow has no `id-token` permission, so it cannot mint the action's GitHub App token. Edits are made locally. No file tool or git form that it may use reaches `.git/`, and it may run only read-only git and `gh` commands.

## Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Token | Secrets | Does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ci.yml` | Pull requests to `dev` or `main`, and pushes to `dev` | `contents: read` | None | One job, `ci`, which calls the shared workflow `checks.yml` of the organization's public [`.github` repository](https://github.com/skkuverse/.github), pinned to a commit. Its job `check` installs with `sfw npm ci`, checks the registry signatures (`npm audit signatures`) and runs `npm run check:ci`. Its job `workflows` runs actionlint and zizmor over this repository. Its job `dependency-review` fails a pull request that adds a dependency with a known vulnerability of high severity or worse. Its job `gate` passes only when each of the others succeeded or was skipped |
| `claude.yml` | An issue or pull request comment that mentions `@claude`, from an owner, member or collaborator. Reviews and review comments start nothing | One job, `read`, in the `claude` environment: `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write`, `issues: write` and `actions: read`; Claude gets this job's own token, which cannot push. No `id-token`, so the job cannot mint the action's GitHub App token | `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | Answers in the pull request or issue and never edits or pushes. `@claude edit` is not a mode: such a comment is answered read-only like any other |
| `contracts-sync.yml` | Daily at 06:00 KST, or by hand | `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write` | `UMBRELLA_DEPLOY_KEY`, `UMBRELLA_REPOSITORY`, `FLEET_READ_TOKEN`, in the `contracts-sync` environment | Compares the vendored contract files with their producers' `main`. When they drift, it checks the pulled files and opens or updates one pull request into `dev` |

Every workflow sets an empty or read-only token at the top and grants more only on the job that needs it. Only `contracts-sync.yml` grants `contents: write`, and no workflow grants `security-events: write`. No workflow uses `pull_request_target`. No `run:` script contains a `${{ }}` expression: an event field, a branch name or a step output reaches a script only through `env:`. Nothing under `.github/` names a private repository. Every action, and the shared workflow `ci.yml` calls, is pinned to a commit SHA with its version as a trailing comment, and Dependabot proposes new pins once a month, for releases at least 5 days old. For npm it opens security updates only. The shared workflow pins what it downloads in its own repository's `tools/versions.env`, which Dependabot does not track: actionlint, zizmor and Socket Firewall, each by version and by the sha256 of what it downloads. `__tests__/nest/infra/workflow-secrets.test.ts`, `workflow-pins.test.ts` and `ci-workflow.test.ts` check these rules.

## Secrets

| Secret | Where | Read by | Why it is safe on a public repository |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | Environment `claude`, whose deployment branch policy admits only `main` | `claude.yml` | The `read` job's `if` requires `author_association` `OWNER`, `MEMBER` or `COLLABORATOR`, and no other job exists, so an outsider's `@claude` starts nothing. An issue comment runs in this repository's context even on a fork's pull request, which is why the check sits on a job, not on a step. An issue comment runs on the default branch, which the environment admits; a workflow run on any other ref cannot read the token, so the workflow listens to no review event. Subprocesses run with `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB`, so a command Claude runs does not inherit the action's credentials |
| `UMBRELLA_DEPLOY_KEY` | `contracts-sync` environment | `contracts-sync.yml` | A read-only deploy key for the private repository that owns the contracts. The workflow runs on a schedule or by hand, so always on the default branch, never for a pull request |
| `UMBRELLA_REPOSITORY` | `contracts-sync` environment | `contracts-sync.yml` | The `owner/name` of that repository. It is a secret, not a variable, so the log masks it |
| `FLEET_READ_TOKEN` | `contracts-sync` environment | `contracts-sync.yml` | A fine-grained token with `contents: read` on the repositories that produce the vendored files, and on nothing else. Same trigger as above |

The `contracts-sync` environment limits deployments to the default branch, so a workflow on any other branch cannot read its secrets. Its three secrets exist only there, with no repository-level copy. No secret exists for `ci.yml`. A pull request from Dependabot or a fork gets no secret.

## CI

`ci.yml` runs on every pull request to `dev` or `main` and on every push to `dev`, so a regression shows on the change that causes it, not only on the release. A newer run on the same ref cancels the older one. The checks are `npm run check:ci` (`scripts/check-ci.sh`), which a local hook runs on the commit it pushes, so CI and the hook check the same things; `ci.yml` only passes that command to the shared workflow. The hook passes `--skip test` and leaves the full Jest run to CI: the only way to leave a step out is that explicit argument, which names the skipped step and fails on a step the script does not have. `__tests__/nest/infra/ci-workflow.test.ts` fails if `ci.yml` does more or passes `--skip`, or if the script branches on whether it runs in CI. The shared workflow checks out the full history: the architecture tests compare the allowlists, exemptions and ratchets with the pull request's base, and fail in CI when the base is missing.

The contract check and the conventions check run tools vendored under `.github/contract-tools/`: the contract checker, the conventions linter and this repository's slice of the contract manifest. They are hash-locked in `.contracts.lock.json` like every other vendored file, so CI clones nothing. `contracts-sync.yml` refreshes them with the rest.

| Failure | Where to look |
| --- | --- |
| `ci / check` | `npm run check:ci` locally, with the `.nvmrc` Node. It runs the steps in CI's order and stops at the first failure; the log groups each step under its name |
| Typecheck, lint, tests | The same commands locally: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` |
| No `mongod` binary | The download during `npm ci` failed: `npm rebuild mongodb-memory-server` |
| `ci / workflows` | `actionlint` and `zizmor --config <tools/zizmor.yml of the shared repository> .` from the repository root, at the versions in the shared repository's `tools/versions.env`. Each finding names the file, the line and the rule |
| Contract integrity | `python3 .github/contract-tools/exported/sync_contracts.py check --repo server --root .` prints the file and both hashes. Do not hand-edit a vendored file: its owner changes it, and the sync pull request brings it here. The vendored checker only checks. `pull`, which rewrites the lock, runs in the maintainers' umbrella repository or in `contracts-sync.yml` |
| Conventions | `python3 .github/contract-tools/exported/lint_conventions.py --root . --only frontmatter --only structure` |
| knip | `npm run knip` |
| `ci / dependency-review` | The job summary names each dependency the pull request adds or changes and the advisory that failed it |

The `workflows` job runs [actionlint](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) and [zizmor](https://docs.zizmor.sh/) over this repository, `.github/dependabot.yml` included. It downloads each release archive at a pinned version and checks its sha256 before it unpacks the archive. zizmor runs online with the job's read-only token, so it also checks that each pinned commit belongs to its action's repository and matches its version comment. A finding fails the job. A deliberate pattern is suppressed in place with `# zizmor: ignore[<rule>]` on the line the finding names, under a `WHY:` comment that gives the reason. A linter is bumped in the shared repository, and this repository picks the bump up when it pins the new commit.

A pull request from a fork waits for a maintainer to approve its workflow runs. A pull request opened by `contracts-sync.yml` uses the workflow's own token, which starts no other workflow. The sync job runs the contract check on the pulled files before it opens the pull request, but the rest of CI does not run: close and reopen the pull request, or push to it, to run CI.

## Branch protection

| Rule | `main` | `dev` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pull request required | Yes | No |
| Merge method | Merge commit only | — |
| Required status checks | `ci / gate` (from `ci.yml`) | — |
| Force push | Blocked | Blocked |
| Deletion | Blocked | Blocked |

Merge `dev` → `main` with a merge commit, never a squash, so `dev` and `main` keep one history.

Pull requests from outside contributors are by invitation ([CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)); `.github/CODEOWNERS` names the owner for every path.

### Dependabot security updates

Dependabot security updates always use the repository's default branch, which is `main`, and `target-branch` does not change that. `.github/dependabot.yml` therefore sets no `target-branch` for npm, and a security pull request for npm opens against `main`. Merge it by hand as soon as `ci / gate` passes, with no wait, and never enable auto-merge. If it is a major version bump, close it: major upgrades are planned separately. Right after the merge, merge `main` back into `dev`, or the next `dev` → `main` pull request conflicts in `package-lock.json`. CI installs with `sfw npm ci`. npm version updates stay off because dependencies are bumped one package per change by hand, and a monthly sweep bumps what an open alert names that Dependabot cannot fix. The `nestjs` group keeps the `@nestjs/*` packages in one pull request, because they must move together.
